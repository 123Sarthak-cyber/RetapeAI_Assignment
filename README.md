# Voicemail Drop Detection & Compliance System ## This repository contains an automated system designed for ClearPath Finance to detect the precise moment a voicemail greeting ends (the "beep") or pauses, allowing for a legally compliant pre-recorded message drop.🚀 OverviewThe challenge of automated voicemail drops is ensuring the message is never "cut off." If a message starts too early, the recipient misses the company name or the call-back number, violating TCPA compliance.This system uses Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to analyze audio in real-time, identifying high-frequency tones (beeps) and silence patterns to trigger the "ClearPath" message at the perfect millisecond.🛠️ Key FeaturesDual-Trigger Logic: Detects 1000Hz standard beeps via FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and human silence via RMS power analysis.Compliance Buffer: Automatically adds a 400ms-1200ms safety window to ensure the recording has actually started.Audio Stitching: Automatically merges the detected "drop point" with the ClearPath compliance message.Interactive Demo: Generates a playable audio player in Google Colab to hear the final result.📁 Project StructurePlaintext├── voicemail_detector.py    # Core logic and DSP classes

⚙️ How It WorksThe system processes audio chunks (100ms) and applies two filters:Frequency Filter: Scans for a peak magnitude between 950Hz and 1050Hz.Silence Filter: Monitors the decibel level. If it stays below -40dB for 1.2 seconds, it assumes the greeting is finished.📊 Audit Results (Sample)Following the processing of the 7 test files, the system generated the following audit log:File NameTriggerTimestampActioncall_01.mp3Beep6.42sDropped Messagecall_02.mp3Silence4.81sDropped Messagecall_03.mp3Beep5.10sDropped Message🎧 Listen to the DemoThe system generates a stitched audio file where you can hear the transition.Output Voice: "Hi, this is ClearPath Finance calling regarding your account. Please call us back at 800-555-0199. Thank you."💻 Installation & UsageClone the repo:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/voicemail-drop-system.git
Install dependencies:Bashpip install numpy pydub scipy
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
Run in Colab:Upload your 7 files and the clearpath_message.mp3 to the /content/ folder and run the run_compliance_test() function.⚖️ Compliance StatementThis software was built with TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) standards in mind. By ensuring the "ClearPath Finance" name and the "800-555-0199" phone number are always played into the recording window, we mitigate the risk of "dead air" or partial message delivery.Developer: Your NameProject: Voicemail Drop Detection SystemOrganization: ClearPath Finance Technical Task
